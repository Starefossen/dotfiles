| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| P0 (Critical) | Functionality breaking | Complete element overlap, content disappearance        |
| P1 (High)     | Serious UX issues      | Unreadable text, inoperable buttons                    |
| P2 (Medium)   | Moderate issues        | Alignment issues, spacing inconsistencies              |
